# rxOC
A copy of the rxOC "version StopGap" Operating System (OS).  This is the final release, circa NOV 2017.  This file is a torrent for the OS, not the OS itself.  You will need BitTorrent or a BitTorrent-compatible filesharing program to download the OS proper.

The rxOC mining OS was originally developed by FullZero.  It is designed for ATI/AMD (Radeon) Graphics cards.  FullZero has given the rights to use and modify this OS to the Public Domain.  The torrent is hosted here for the sake of keeping the OS alive.
